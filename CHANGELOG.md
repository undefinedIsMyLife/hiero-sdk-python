  – docs: Updated README.md/CHANGELOG.md and added blog.md, bud.md and setup.md (#474)
- renamed docs/sdk_developers/changelog.md to docs/sdk_developers/changelog_entry.md for clarity.
- Refactor `query_balance.py` into modular, reusable functions with `setup_client()`, `create_account()`, `get_balance()`, `transfer_hbars()`, and `main()` for improved readability, maintainability, and error handling.
- Unified balance and transfer logging format — both now consistently display values in hbars for clarity.

### Fixed

- Add type hints to `setup_client()` and `create_new_account()` functions in `examples/account_create.py` (#418)
- Added explicit read and write permissions to test.yml
- Type hinting for `Topic` related transactions.

### Removed

- Remove deprecated camelCase alias support and `_DeprecatedAliasesMixin`; SDK now only exposes snake_case attributes for `NftId`, `TokenInfo`, and `TransactionReceipt`. (Issue #428)
